## Bash, the language.

Most books about Bash write about Bash as a Unix **utility**.

Few books write about Bash as if it were a **programming language**.

Writing books to **teach a programming language** is a somewhat **tried and true** technique of teaching readers.

If you read an introductory book about **Java**, the outline of the book will be _very similar_ to an introductory book about **Python** or **C#** or most any other programming language.

**The Adventurer's Guide to Bash** teaches Bash _like a programming language._

## Opinionated

This book, like all technical books, is full of **opinions.**

These are [[@beccasaurus|my]] **opinions**.

There are a _lot of ways to write Bash programs._

If I tried to teach you _every possible way_ of writing a single line of Bash code, you would be overwhelmed with different possibilities.

I use _consistent code_ throughout the book which teaches _my_ opinion of the "Best" way to write Bash code.

## Best Practices

If you search for _"**Bash Best Practices**"_ what you'll find is a lot of inconsistent recommendations, mostly a mix of Bash and general Shell Scripting recommendations.

Most general purpose programming languages have a _much more consistent_ set of well-known and used _"Best Practices."_

I have come up with my _own_ set of _"**Best Practices**"_ which I teach throughout this book, based on my over 15 years of professional software development.

## Dungeons & Dragons

I enjoy the **fantasy** genre.

If you don't enjoy (_or cannot tolerate_) reading about _Goblins_ and _Dragons_, then you will not enjoy this book.

I initially named this book "**Beautiful Bash**" and wrote using generic terms, like using variables named `variable1` and `variable2`.

It just felt a bit to *"dry"* for my taste. It was honestly really **boring**.

So I updated the book and _now_ the code examples are about `dragons` and `goblins` and heroes!

**I hope you enjoy it.**

*I understand it's not for everyone.*
