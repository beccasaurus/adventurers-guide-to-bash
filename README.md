Many reasons.

### ⚔️ Adventurer's Guide to Bash ([`https://adventurers-guide.sh`][guide])

It's going to take me many, many months to author the book.

Rather than doing this in private, I am authoring the book using a public wiki.

You can view the public wiki where I'm drafting the book at [`adventurers-guide.sh`][guide]

> ℹ️ As of June 2021, I legit _just setup this wiki_ and there may be very little content.
